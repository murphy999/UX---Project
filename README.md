# User Flow

User Flow is the path a user follows through an application. The flow doesn’t have to be linear, it can branch out in a non-linear path. By determining this path you can see possible turns through the route and can optimize the user experience.
User flows can start off simple and help determine ‘red routes’ — key user journeys. These can easily evolve into complex flows when there are many conditions and requirements involved. User flows are helpful in hashing out complex flows before building out the product.



# Use Case

Use case diagram is a behavioral UML diagram type and frequently used to analyze various systems. They enable you to visualize the different types of roles in a system and how those roles interact with the system.

Importance of Use Case Diagrams

1. To identify functions and how roles interact with them.
2. For a high-level view of the system – Especially useful when presenting to managers or stakeholders. You can highlight the roles that      interact with the system and the functionality provided by the system without going deep into inner workings of the system.
3. To identify internal and external factors.
