# Persona

A User Persona is a representation of a particular audience segment for a product or service you are designing. It captures their motivations, frustrations and gives you an overview of who they are as an individual. 

# There are three specific things to think about.

1. Personas can be used to share research findings and insights within your team. But they can also serve as a common language to align an    interdisciplinary team or align multiple organizations. 
 
2. Personas can help create buy-in. They help gain buy-in on a specific user problem or need within the team or even outside of the team.

3. Empathy. They help a team to get onto the same page and step into the shoes of different customer groups, to understand their needs.

# A persona can contain a variety of information that can help us ‘paint’ a picture of our user. The information could include:

- Demographic data - name, age, sex, location
- Goals and motivations
- Technical ability and device usage
- Other brands or websites they may like
