# Analysis
The aim of the Analysis phase is to draw insights from data collected during the Research phase. Communicating the designerâ€™s understanding back to end-users helps to confirm that any assumptions being made are valid. Techniques used during this phase are : 

<h4>1. Persona</h4> - https://github.com/murphy999/UX---Project/tree/Persona

<h4>2. Use Case / User Flow</h4> - https://github.com/murphy999/UX---Project/tree/useCase

<h4>3. Storyboard</h4> - https://github.com/murphy999/UX---Project/blob/Storyboard/README.md

# Design
The Design phase of a UX project is collaborative (involving input and ideas from different people) and iterative (meaning that it cycles back upon itself to validate ideas and assumptions). Building on the user feedback loop established in previous phases, the premise of the Design phase is to put ideas in front of users, get their feedback, refine them, and repeat. These ideas may be represented by paper prototypes, interactive wireframes, or semi-functioning prototypes, all deliberately created in low-fidelity to delay any conversation relating to graphic identity, branding or visual details.
